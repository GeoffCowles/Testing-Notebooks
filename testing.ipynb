    "In this notebook you will work through some interactive exercises to help you understand how multiple constituents combine to generate the tide.  In the first exercise you will study how the superposition of two waveforms of different frequencies (periods) can lead to longer period fluctuations in the resulting signal.   The second exercise will help you see how this superposition leads to the well known spring-neap (fortnightly) variation in tides.  The third exercise explains the cause of *diurnal inequality* or differences in the heights of sequential high or low tides.  The last exercise will ask you to construct realistic tidal time series using the dominant five constituents from two locations in the U.S., one in New England and the other in the Pacific Northwest and compare them.  \n",

    "### Superposition of Waves:  Beats\n",
    "\n",
    "In this excercise you will see what happens when two waves of different amplitudes and frequencies are added together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by maximizing the amplitude of wave 1.  You should see a pure sine wave of amplitude 1.   Then, increase the amplitude of wave 2.  You will see that the superposition of two waves of the same frequency and phase leads to a waveform with an amplitude equal to that of the sum of the amplitude the two waves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the amplitude of wave 2 to 50% of that of wave 1.  Then, slowly increase the period ratio.  At a period ratio very close to, but slightly greater than 1, you should begin to see that the extrema of the resultant tide height (black line) are themselves oscillating at a period that is much greater than the period of either of the waves.  This *slower* oscillation is a called a *beat* and is shown graphically by the dashed lines connecting the extrema.  This curve is called the *envelope*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Continue increasing the ratio of the periods (T2/T1).  What happens to the period of the beating.  Does it increase or decrease? "

    "### Spring Neap Cycle ($M_2$+$S_2$) and Influence of Perigee ($N_2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive exercise you will explore how the interaction of the $M_2$ (principal lunar semi-diurnal) and $S_2$ (principal solar semi-diurnal) constituents can generate an approximately 14-day variation known as the spring-neap cycle.  You will also observe how the $N_2$ component (the solar elliptical) can temper or enhance alternating spring/neap cycles.  The $N_2$ represents the influence of the ellipticity of the moon's orbit around the earth which oscillates between residing at a point nearest the earth (perigee) to a point furthest from the earth (apogee) on a 27.55 day cycle. The ellipticity of the moon's orbit (ratio of minor to major axis) is approximately 5%.  The variations in the spring/neap cycle are notable in many locations on the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with non-zero $M_2$ amplitude and add in the $S_2$.  You will see the distinct spring-neap cycle form. The dashed line is the envelope of extrema.  It is only displayed to help visualize the spring-neap varation.  The blue line is the actual time series of tide height.  Unless some resonance is in play, the $S_2$ will be significantly smaller than the $M_2$.  In New Bedford the $S_2$ amplitude is 22% that of the $M_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increase the $N_2$ amplitude and you will see how it leads to a variation in the spring neap cycle.  In New Bedford, the $N_2$ and $S_2$ constituents have similar amplitude.  Try dropping the $S_2$ towards zero with nonzero $N_2$ and $M_2$.  Note the approximate period of the envelope.   \n",
